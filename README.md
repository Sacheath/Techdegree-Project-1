# Description of Project 1
This project is intended as a number guessing game. A random number will be generated. Players will be shown the high score and prompted to select a number from 1-100 and receive feedback on whether to guess higher or lower. 
Once the answer is correctly guessed, players will be asked if they would to play again. Their statistics will be displayed if they decline.


# Instructions for Project 1
Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way. For example, non-number guesses should be handled with an exception.

As a player of the game, I should see some kind of text header, welcome, or game intro message.

A random number should be chosen that is within the range of 1 - 100.

As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.

As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess, I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer so that I can narrow down my guesses.

After the game ends save the playerâ€™s number of attempts at guessing to a list.

As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown

My number of attempts at guessing.

The mean of the saved attempts list

The median of the saved attempts list

The mode of the saved attempts list

As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.

Every time a player decides to play again, the random number to guess is updated so players are guessing something new each time.

When the game ends, an ending message is shown to the player.

# Extra Credit for Project 1
As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.

As a player of the game, at the start of each game, I should be shown the current best score (least amount of points) so that I know what I am supposed to beat.

When printing a formatted string to the console, use f-strings to format them.

Create a README.md file for your project. Inside the file, describe what your project does.
